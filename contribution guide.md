# Contribution Guide
Please contact the repository owner before commencing development to be added as a contributor.

## Selecting a task
Development tasks are maintained as issues. Unless explicitly discussed otherwise, development should be designed to close issues. Tasks should be simple and atomic, if there are two distinct elements of the task that need to be created, it should be two separate issues and two separate tasks, if possible. Once a task has been selected, the issue will be assigned to you on github.

## Branching and development
When you have chosen a task, create a branch off `main` and start development work. Try to maintain the style that already exists in the codebase and comment things that you are doing that might be confusing to a reader. Test your changes! It is strongly recommended you make a test bot account and a test discord server and run your changes locally to make sure it runs exactly as expected. If you are changing things that might affect other existing features, make sure you test those as well.

## PR process
When development is complete, push to github and create a pull request. The request will then be reviewed with possible changes requested, and once approved it will be merged into main.
